Hello Everyone

This is frontend based application. In this application, i can build a frontend pages using react. 

This is a small application i was build in health care domain, now a days we all are facing lot of health issues, in case of senior citizens we take some of common issues and we generated small awareness, in this app i can added feature to take a test in your home. When you fill the form with in 15 minutes our health advisor will contact you, with in 24 hours we can deliver your test results accurately.

Also we can share track of your test results through the whatsapp (currently not available).

I thought that only the medication is not working through all diseases so i can innovate a new feature for senior citizens. In this feature they got how to spend a life in day to day. (This feature is because health is not only depends on our body, it also depends on our feelings, our surroundings, and how our thought process will going. So i hope this feature show some results in our life.)
